##Javascript Review
#
#object literal - key value pairs
#functions are objects
#everything is an object
#events: user interactions to listen to and take action on
#functional scope "this"
#jquery - addresses browser incompatibilies, easy to traverse dom, animation
#ajax - make server request/http call within a page, page doens't need to refresh
#json - javascript object notation, way to store and transport data
#
#
#
##Design Patterns - common ways to building software that people have figured out over time
#
#Observer - events...ehhh..
#MVC - way to structure code so separate presentation logic from data
#SOA - service oriented architecture - break app down to different services that can communicate with eachother...lots of little apps connected to eachother
#
#
#ajax problem...select something that isn't already there...event delegation
#
#
#Backbone - provides tools, doesn't dictate structure, very lightweight
#Angular - makes you structure the code a certain way
#
#Underscore - toolbelt different 

Components

Model - represents data
in backbone, there is a model already configured for you that you can take and modify
